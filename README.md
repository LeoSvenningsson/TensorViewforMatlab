# TensorViewforMatlab
TensorView for Matlab is a tool to visualize chemical shift/shielding tensors in a molecular context. TensorView for Matlab can read arbitrary .pdb and .xyz files for molecular visualization. The chemical shift/shielding tensor is used as an input in script, though any 3D tensor can be used for visualisation.

Versions for windows and mac reside in their respective folder which only requires the matab compiler. The Scource folder contains the matlab code, but also include a matlab script which can be run with matlab. As of now, there are more camera options for the script version using matlab, which is why it is included separately.
